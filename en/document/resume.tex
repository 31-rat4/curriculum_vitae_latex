After reaching the position of Senior JavaScript Developer, I pursued the path of software architecture with the goal of solving recurring problems I observed in the field. \par
Over time, I discovered that my communication skills are crucial in software development, as "a perfect software is useless for the wrong client.".\par
I am in the search to become THE whitefly, following the path of masters as \textit{"Stephen Wolfram"}, \textit{"John von Neumann"} , \textit{"Leonhard Euler"} and many, MANY others ... singing the beauty of being an eternal apprentice.\par
