I have 10 years of experience in various tec areas and 5 years in sales. My expertise spans Backend, Frontend, Cloud, User Experience, Cybersecurity/Infrastructure, IoT, Cryptocurrencies/Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, and Chatbots.Over time, I discovered that my communication skills are crucial in software development, as "a perfect software is useless for the wrong client." After reaching the position of Senior JavaScript Developer, I pursued the path of software architecture with the goal of solving recurring problems I observed in the field. I strive to balance opposites to gain a broader perspective, as those on the fence have a better view.
